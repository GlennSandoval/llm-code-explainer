# Code Parser Application Plan

## Overview
The Code Parser is a specialized application that analyzes source code from local git repositories and generates natural language descriptions of the code. It leverages Tree-sitter for accurate code parsing and Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating human-readable descriptions.

## Core Features
- Parse and analyze source code from local git repositories
- Support multiple programming languages through Tree-sitter
- Generate natural language descriptions of code files
- Flexible LLM provider support

## Technical Requirements

### Supported Programming Languages
The application supports the following languages through Tree-sitter:
1. Python (.py)
2. JavaScript (.js)
3. TypeScript (.ts)
4. Ruby (.rb)
5. Go (.go)
6. Java (.java)
7. C++ (.cpp)
8. C (.c)
9. Rust (.rs)
10. PHP (.php)

### Dependencies
- Tree-sitter language modules for each supported language
- LLM provider libraries (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenLLaMA)
- Git integration capabilities
- Python type hints support

### Environment Configuration
The application supports multiple LLM providers configured through environment variables:
- OpenAI
- Anthropic
- OpenLLaMA

## Architecture Components

### 1. Language Configuration System
- Maintains mappings between file extensions and Tree-sitter language modules
- Provides utilities for language detection and parsing capability verification
- Centralizes language support configuration

### 2. Code Parser
- Utilizes Tree-sitter for accurate syntax tree generation
- Handles different programming languages through language-specific parsers
- Extracts relevant code structures and patterns

### 3. LLM Integration
- Flexible provider system supporting multiple LLM services
- Environment-based configuration
- Standardized interface for LLM interactions

### 4. Repository Handler
- Git repository access and navigation
- File filtering based on supported languages
- Recursive directory traversal

## Implementation Details

### Input Processing
1. Accept path to local git repository
2. Validate repository access and structure
3. Identify supported language files using extension mapping

### Code Analysis Flow
1. For each supported file:
   - Determine appropriate language parser
   - Generate syntax tree using Tree-sitter
   - Extract relevant code structures
   - Pass to LLM for natural language description

### LLM Integration
1. Load configuration from environment variables
2. Initialize appropriate LLM client
3. Process code analysis results
4. Generate human-readable descriptions

### Output Generation
- Natural language descriptions for each analyzed file
- Optional: Summary of repository structure
- Optional: Relationships between different code files

## Future Considerations
1. Support for additional programming languages
2. Enhanced code relationship analysis
3. Custom description templates
4. Batch processing capabilities
5. Integration with CI/CD pipelines
